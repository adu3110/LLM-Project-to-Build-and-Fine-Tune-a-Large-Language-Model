    "# **LLM Project to Build and Fine Tune a Large Language Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, the ability to process and generate natural language text at scale has become a transformative force across industries. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a cutting-edge advancement in natural language processing, enabling businesses to extract valuable insights, automate tasks, and enhance user experiences. By harnessing the power of LLMs, organizations can improve customer service, automate content creation, and gain a competitive edge in the digital landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds the foundation for Large Language Models by diving deep into the details of their inner workings. Moreover, It shows how to optimize their use through prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques such as LoRA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering techniques involve crafting specific instructions or queries given to the language model to influence its output will be introduced to guide LLMs in generating desired responses through zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning entails training a pre-trained language model on a specific task or dataset to adapt it for a particular application. It explores full fine-tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT), a technique that optimizes the fine-tuning process by focusing on a subset of the model's parameters, making it more resource-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project also involves the application of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, resulting in the development of a chatbot for online shopping for knowledge grounding. Knowledge grounding with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented to mitigate hallucinations and provide trustworthy and reliable responses. This is achieved by incorporating information from external sources to validate and support the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the context of an e-commerce chatbot using RAG, knowledge grounding ensures that product information, availability, and prices are sourced from a trusted database or e-commerce platform. This prevents the chatbot from generating inaccurate or fictional details and instead provides responses based on real-world data.\n",

    "\n",
    "**One-to-Many**: One-to-Many is a type of RNN that gives multiple outputs when given a single input. It takes a fixed input size and gives a sequence of data outputs. Its applications can be found in Music Generation and Image Captioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Many-to-One**: Many-to-One is used when a single output is required from multiple input units or a sequence of them. It takes a sequence of inputs to display a fixed output. Sentiment Analysis is a common example of this type of Recurrent Neural Network.\n",

    "Now, even though RNNs are quite powerful, they suffer from Vanishing gradient problem which hinders them from using long term information, like they are good for storing memory 3-4 instances of past iterations but larger number of instances don't provide good results so we don't just use regular RNNs. Instead, we use a better variation of RNNs: Long Short Term Networks(LSTM).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Vanishing Gradient problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanishing gradient problem is a difficulty found in training artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In such methods, each of the neural network's weights receives an update proportional to the partial derivative of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. The problem is that in some cases, the gradient will be vanishingly small, effectively preventing the weight from changing its value. In the worst case, this may completely stop the neural network from further training. As one example of the problem cause, traditional activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent function have gradients in the range (0, 1), and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule. This has the effect of multiplying n of these small numbers to compute gradients of the \"front\" layers in an n-layer network, meaning that the gradient (error signal) decreases exponentially with n while the front layers train very slowly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Long short-term memory (LSTM) units (or blocks) are a building unit for layers of a recurrent neural network (RNN). A RNN composed of LSTM units is often called an LSTM network. A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for \"remembering\" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word \"memory\" in LSTM. Each of the three gates can be thought of as a \"conventional\" artificial neuron, as in a multi-layer (or feedforward) neural network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. Intuitively, they can be thought as regulators of the flow of values that goes through the connections of the LSTM; hence the denotation \"gate\". There are connections between these gates and the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression long short-term refers to the fact that LSTM is a model for the short-term memory which can last for a long period of time. An LSTM is well-suited to classify, process and predict time series given time lags of unknown size and duration between important events. LSTMs were developed to deal with the exploding and vanishing gradient problem when training traditional RNNs.\n",

What sets Transformers apart is their unique attention mechanism, which allows them to process input data in parallel rather than sequentially. This means they can consider the relationships between all elements in a sequence simultaneously, making them exceptionally efficient. The attention mechanism works by assigning weights to different parts of the input, highlighting the most relevant information. Transformers are composed of multiple layers, each containing a multi-head self-attention sub-layer and a feedforward neural network sub-layer. These layers are stacked to form the core of the model. \n",

    "\n",
    "Knowledge grounding in Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the process of connecting or linking information in text to real-world entities or concepts. It involves ensuring that the language model understands and can relate the information it processes to factual, contextual, or external knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if a sentence mentions \"Einstein's theory of relativity,\" knowledge grounding would involve the model recognizing that Einstein refers to a renowned physicist and the theory of relativity is a fundamental concept in physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge grounding is crucial for NLP applications that require a deeper understanding of the world, as it enables the model to go beyond surface-level patterns in text and make meaningful inferences based on its understanding of the underlying concepts. This is particularly important in tasks like question-answering, where the model needs to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "Knowledge grounding with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented to mitigate hallucinations and provide trustworthy and reliable responses. This is achieved by incorporating information from external sources to validate and support the generated text.\n"

    "\n",
    "This project was all about getting to know these language models inside out. We looked at how they work, how we can use them better, and even gave them a bit of a tune-up. We made them smarter by teaching them how to answer questions and summarize conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also built a cool shopping chatbot. This bot is smart because it doesn't make up stuff; it gives you real info about products.\n",
